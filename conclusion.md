# Conclusion

Comprehensive solution for key management is the first of it’s kind and offers strong foundation for the Iryo network to stay usable but still offer unprecedented privacy and security guarantees, that are not based on \(always failing\) centralised trust. Instead it distributes the access to the ‘edge’ of the platform, where people who care the most about the data.

In the spirit of the bitcoin, Iryo network removes the need for \(patient\) identity, replaces it with mathematical control over his medical data. This allows Iryo network to bypass traps associated with stolen identity, phishing attacks and avoids liability with verification of the identity \(false positives, false negatives, missing the data on the patient\).

Patient &gt; Doctor &gt; Clinic dynamics keeps the system honest, secure and private and allows the system to finally scale over the national borders bringing unprecedented network effect to the table. The historically fragmented field can finally start building on top of Iryo open network and start serving patients instead of going through yet another round of interoperability nightmare.
