# Abstract

Patients health records are classified as one of the most sensitive personal information. When data leaks, it can be used to target individuals reputation,his employment options, insurance premium, or is used as a marketing tool, taking advantage of the ill and their desperation.



On the other hand, medical data has to be readily available to different institutions and countries in cases of needed medical care; to prevent bad outcomes in emergency care due to lack of medical information about a patient.. Additionally, many research artificial intelligence platforms are looking at ways to access your data to improve our knowledge, provide early detection of diseases and invent new treatments.



These two approaches are at odds with each other- causing medical data to stay in the ungrateful middle, where it can only serve inside tightly controlled siloses. It canâ€™t empower its owner and it adds friction to \(ai\) research. 



Iryo is the first health records project that merges both worlds. 



It consist of an open access to the platform \(api\), open-source client code, and by using open standards ensure interoperability, transparency and security.
